/*
Package colors provides a handy reference to names colors for the Watermark color field.

Watermark colors can also be a [0x|#]RRGGBB[AA] sequence, possibly followed by @ and a string representing the alpha component.
The alpha component may be a string composed by "0x" followed by an hexadecimal number or
a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, which represents the opacity value
(‘0x00’ or ‘0.0’ means completely transparent, ‘0xff’ or ‘1.0’ completely opaque).
If the alpha component is not specified then ‘0xff’ is assumed.
